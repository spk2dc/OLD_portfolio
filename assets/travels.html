      One of my favorite ways to spend my time is traveling. I have always had a
      curiousity to explore the unknown and a passion for seeking out new
      experiences. The first time I studied abroad in college, I knew I had to
      do it again and keep wandering as much as I could to see what else was out
      there just beyond the horizon in places I had never been to before.

      This drive has led me on countless trips to countries scattered across the
      world, from India to Germany to South Africa to Thailand. And most
      recently I took my biggest trip of all. In October of 2019 I decided to
      backpack across Asia for 5 months. I started off traveling through Japan,
      took a boat to South Korea, then headed to Taiwan. Unfortunately, soon
      after I arrived in Taiwan, so did the coronavirus pandemic. Despite having
      to end my trip a little early, I am grateful to have had the opportunity
      and privelege to take such an extensive trip through so many new places.

      Traveling has given me invaluable experiences that have helped me grow as
      a person and learn about cultures and people different from the ones I
      have been raised around. Being exposed to diverse perspectives from all
      over the world has helped give me a unique way of approaching problems and
      working together with people from all walks of life to solve today's
      challenges in new ways.
